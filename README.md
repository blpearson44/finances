# finances
This project is really just to force myself to learn how to import csv and json data formats, for now at least.
The end goal is to create a python app that allows me to make new entries for finances, and then a Jupyter notebook for data reporting via matplotlib.
Thought about toying around with SQL a bit too - I have a bit of experience just messing around but not actual use. Maybe eventually.

As it stands it is pretty barebones, it can read in data for account info from a JSON and transaction info from CSV and that's about it.
But the data is there and ready for me to mess around with, I just gotta get data entry going and work on making plots.
